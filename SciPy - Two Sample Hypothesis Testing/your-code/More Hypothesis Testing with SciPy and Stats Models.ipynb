    "# More Hypothesis Testing with SciPy and Stats Models\n",

    "Lesson Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will learn more about tests that we can perform with SciPy. These tests allow us to make decisions based on data and compare information in two or more variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of statistics helps us make decisions using data. In previous lessons, we have looked at the comparison of one sample to a constant or the comparison of two samples to each other. In this lesson, we will use statistical tools to examine a number of features at once. We will also learn about linear regression using SciPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA and the F-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA (or ANalysis Of VAriance) is a technique meant to compare the means of three or more independent samples. An example of when we might use ANOVA is when conducting a test on an e-commerce website and trying out multiple UI designs at once to see if there is a change in sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the ANOVA is a table consisting of values that help us compute a p-value for our hypothesis. The p-value will be found by performing the F-test. The F-test is a test for comparing variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the ANOVA, we compare the difference in variation between the groups and the difference in variation within the groups themselves. If the F statistic is sufficiently large, this means the p-value will be sufficiently small. This will lead us to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is significant variation between the groups and therefore at least one of the means is different."
